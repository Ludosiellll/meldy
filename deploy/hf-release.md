# Hugging Face releases

Each change to this file on `claude/relaxed-hypatia-1tpmq5` runs `.github/workflows/deploy-hf.yml`:
the live Space `main` is tagged `hf-backup-<UTC>-pre-push`, then the released tree (without `qa-screens/`)
is pushed on top of it, and the job waits for `RUNNING` and checks `/` and `/api/health`.

## 2026-10-04 — owner fixes and jury fixes (from 7f6ab03)

Replaces 77d43d8 (tree of e366fa7). Includes the jury fixes `1c1bd10` (confirmation rule, grade cap, honest
sheet, «Сегодня», landing) and the owner's six live-site issues except the knowledge map, which follows separately:

- Readable lecture titles instead of file names (review card no longer overflows).
- Paper dropdowns and subject suggestions instead of native `<select>`/`<datalist>`.
- Lecture picker: select all / none, search, subject groups, scrolling list.
- Material summary uses the width: the lecture fragment of the section being read on the right margin, outline;
  `[S01, S02]` marks become fragment links.
- «Разговор» audio: server retries and clip cache, Max's voice never switches to the browser voice, no markdown
  in lines.

Database: migration `20261004054539_jury_trust_reads` was applied on 2026-10-04 (restrictive reads; the old client
keeps working).

Verified before release: tsc -b and Vitest 1482/1482 on the exact release tree, pytest 703, production build,
browser smoke of the main pages at 1440 dark and 390 light on mocked Supabase/API, screenshots of the changed
screens. Not verified: live edge-tts timing and live AI providers — check right after the release.

## 2026-10-04 — Meldy for the hackathon (from e366fa7)

Replaces the live version f3b94ba (2026-09-24, still branded StudyForge).

- Meldy name everywhere, secondary features out of the menu, dead code removed.
- New landing «Строчка → карточка»; paper-desk top bar and screens.
- «Разговор»: two hosts with synced diagrams, charts and terms.
- Analysis always ends (full, partial with «Создать заново», or a readable error); nothing is saved or charged
  without a core section; paste-text input; no made-up grades; models and timeouts from env.
- Answer journal (`learning_events`), quiz results and mistakes saved, honest «Прогресс».
- «Билеты»: question list mapped to the student's lectures, share of tickets, «Тянуть билет».
- «Ответ вслух»: spoken answer, code-verified quotes, follow-up on the missed point, protocol.

Database: migration `20261003083154_hackathon_journal_exams_oral` was applied on 2026-10-03 (additive; the old
client keeps working).

Verified before release: tsc -b, Vitest 1169/1169, pytest 681, production build, isolated frontend build as in
the Docker image, three rounds of browser QA on mocked Supabase/API. Not verified: live AI providers and real
speech recognition (no keys in the build environment) — check right after the release.
