# Hugging Face releases

Each change to this file on `claude/relaxed-hypatia-1tpmq5` runs `.github/workflows/deploy-hf.yml`:
the live Space `main` is tagged `hf-backup-<UTC>-pre-push`, then the released tree (without `qa-screens/`)
is pushed on top of it, and the job waits for `RUNNING` and checks `/` and `/api/health`.

## 2026-10-04 — «Прогресс» reworked (from 1d4fff5)

Adds to 6cd8316 (tree of 4ea342b). The owner: «может стоит переработать этот раздел "Прогресс" … читать тяжело и не
сильно понятно, да и не функционально» and «я разрешаю полностью переработать эту страницу». The page now answers three
questions, and every block has one action:

- Three tiles at the top:
  - «Карточки»: закреплены / учатся / новые;
  - «Вспомнили»: the share of «Помню» and «С трудом» answers from the journal, shown from 10 answers;
  - «Повторения на неделю»: by the cards' schedule, with «Повторить».
- «Что подтянуть», each line with one button:
  - lectures recalled under 70 %;
  - open mistakes;
  - cards that never reached review («Добавить»);
  - exam questions found in no lecture;
  - untaken tests, as one line.
- Exams as before. Each lecture is a row: test and mistakes, card states, its recall, and one next step («Повторить N»,
  «В повторение», «Пройти тест», or the date of the next review). Text-only lectures are folded away.
- New links: `/review?material=<id>` and `/library/<id>?section=quiz` (the material opens on its test tab).
- The answer journal starts on 2026-10-03, so until 30 days fit after it the share says «с 3 октября», and
  «Как считается» explains it.

No migration and no backend change; the page reads the same tables as before.

Verified before release: tsc -b and Vitest 1492/1492, production build, Playwright screenshots of «Прогресс» on
three data sets (like the owner's account, a rich one, an empty one) at 1440/390 in both themes — no overflow, no
console errors, text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 — and the «Пройти тест» and «Повторить N» links in the browser. Not verified:
the owner's live data on this page.

## 2026-10-04 — the whole site in the new language (from bc3e70b)

Adds to 0a11c46 (tree of 31e3694). The owner approved the new visual language («адаптируй полностью весь сайт
далее под нужный дизайн»), and every screen now uses it: light canvas, deep ink, one blue accent with yellow, green
and pink, Onest only, large rounded cards, pill buttons with a circle arrow, status pills, halftone panels, and a
dark theme.

- New landing around the reel (hero with the exam/credit/colloquium toggle, ticker, «how it works» cards that
  jump to the reel's chapters, method, final call).
- «Сегодня», «Добавить лекцию», library, material page (summary, cards, test, «Разговор»), shared material,
  exams, the draw and the oral answer with its protocol, review, mistakes, progress, gradebook, the knowledge map
  (now set in Onest), sign-in, profile and pricing. Hidden secondary screens are restyled through a scoped
  stylesheet.
- Shared pieces: browser bar colour, app icon, update toast, «Нет подключения» page.
- Fixes found on the way:
  - the offline page never opened (wrong cache key) and its button was blocked by the CSP;
  - phone tabs were cut off;
  - the top bar overlapped at 1024 px;
  - focus rings squared off rounded elements;
  - dark-theme blue text was 3.2–3.8:1;
  - «Удалить предмет» did nothing in a subject's view;
  - the shorts player showed a made-up like counter.

No data or behaviour changes beyond these fixes; no migration; backend unchanged since 31e3694.

Verified before release on bc3e70b:
- tsc -b, Vitest 1471/1471 (95 files);
- production build (no Literata font files left in the assets);
- browser sweep of 30 routes at 1440 and 390 in both themes on mocked Supabase/API: no horizontal overflow, no
  text below 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text). The only console errors are /career's mock 406/404 on an empty career
  profile.
- Offline fallback checked in Chromium with the built service worker.

## 2026-10-04 — the motion reel on the landing (from d1b7c8e)

Adds to b07ade9: «Meldy за 35 секунд» under the hero — a code-built motion reel in the new style (chapters
Билеты, Ответ вслух, Повторение, Готовность), muted, plays only while on screen, chapter bar under it, still frame
under reduced motion. Lazy chunk, no new dependencies, no data read.

Verified before release: tsc -b, Vitest 1545/1545 (100 files), production build; the landing at 1440 and 390 in
both themes without horizontal overflow; 175 frames of the reel reviewed (5 per second).

## 2026-10-04 — knowledge map back in the menu (from ce131a8)

Adds to 827588d: «Карта знаний» returns — lecture cards in course order with the concepts they share, readiness
marks on question numbers, a paper panel with fragments and mistakes, a list view (default on phones). In the top bar
from 1280 px, otherwise in the account menu.

Verified before release: tsc -b and Vitest 1525/1525 on the release tree; map screenshots at 1440 and 390 in both
themes on mocked Supabase (no overflow, no console errors). Data is read only: no migration.

## 2026-10-04 — owner fixes and jury fixes (from 7f6ab03 + review leftovers)

First attempt (run 4) stopped before pushing: `git fetch` from the Space failed on the runner's git 2.55 protocol v2
("expected 'acknowledgments'"); the workflow now fetches with protocol v1. The live Space was not touched.
Also in this release: a spoken «не знаю» keeps the grade cap, the protocol stamp lands only after the save, the why
panel keeps a fragment's heading on its own line (Vitest 1485/1485 and tsc -b on the exact tree).

Replaces 77d43d8 (tree of e366fa7). Includes the jury fixes `1c1bd10` (confirmation rule, grade cap, honest
sheet, «Сегодня», landing) and the owner's six live-site issues except the knowledge map, which follows separately:

- Readable lecture titles instead of file names (review card no longer overflows).
- Paper dropdowns and subject suggestions instead of native `<select>`/`<datalist>`.
- Lecture picker: select all / none, search, subject groups, scrolling list.
- Material summary uses the width: the lecture fragment of the section being read on the right margin, outline;
  `[S01, S02]` marks become fragment links.
- «Разговор» audio: server retries and clip cache, Max's voice never switches to the browser voice, no markdown
  in lines.

Database: migration `20261004054539_jury_trust_reads` was applied on 2026-10-04 (restrictive reads; the old client
keeps working).

Verified before release: tsc -b and Vitest 1482/1482 on the exact release tree, pytest 703, production build,
browser smoke of the main pages at 1440 dark and 390 light on mocked Supabase/API, screenshots of the changed
screens. Not verified: live edge-tts timing and live AI providers — check right after the release.

## 2026-10-04 — Meldy for the hackathon (from e366fa7)

Replaces the live version f3b94ba (2026-09-24, still branded StudyForge).

- Meldy name everywhere, secondary features out of the menu, dead code removed.
- New landing «Строчка → карточка»; paper-desk top bar and screens.
- «Разговор»: two hosts with synced diagrams, charts and terms.
- Analysis always ends (full, partial with «Создать заново», or a readable error); nothing is saved or charged
  without a core section; paste-text input; no made-up grades; models and timeouts from env.
- Answer journal (`learning_events`), quiz results and mistakes saved, honest «Прогресс».
- «Билеты»: question list mapped to the student's lectures, share of tickets, «Тянуть билет».
- «Ответ вслух»: spoken answer, code-verified quotes, follow-up on the missed point, protocol.

Database: migration `20261003083154_hackathon_journal_exams_oral` was applied on 2026-10-03 (additive; the old
client keeps working).

Verified before release: tsc -b, Vitest 1169/1169, pytest 681, production build, isolated frontend build as in
the Docker image, three rounds of browser QA on mocked Supabase/API. Not verified: live AI providers and real
speech recognition (no keys in the build environment) — check right after the release.
